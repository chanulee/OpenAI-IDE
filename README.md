# OpenAI-IDE Sandbox Sessions
- We are partnering with **OpenAI** to explore **post-conversational AI interfaces**, putting innovation methodology into practice while experiencing the IDE approach to design engineering challenges.
- We've designed four Sandbox sessions to help students navigate the SOTA AI landscape, spot opportunities for design engineers, set up developer environment, and build practical AI skills, supporting both current module and future IDE modules.

<summary><h3>Brief: Designing Beyond Conversational Interfaces</h3></summary>

<!-- Begin ToC -->
> Chat was only the beginning. With AI now able to see, listen, plan, act, and adapt, we are entering an era where human-AI interactions extend far beyond text boxes and touchscreens. Your challenge is to design and prototype a new mode of interaction with AI - multimodal, agentive, or embodied - that does more than 'work': it should reimagine how humans and AI share agency in complex systems.
> 
> Think of AI not as a layer of software, but as a new material - one we can touch, sense, and weave into the everyday. Like a tool that expands our capabilities, AI can be shaped into the things we use, the spaces we share, the experiences we inhabit.
> 
> As you experiment hands-on with emerging capabilities, keep asking yourself: **How could this interaction foster trust, creativity, or collective decision-making?** Guided by systemic design thinking, approach your prototype not as a finished product, but as a living intervention within wider social, ecological, and technological systems. 
> 
> **The goal is to provoke insight, spark debate, and demonstrate how design engineering can shape human-AI interactions towards futures where human judgment, ethics, and creativity remain central.**
